# Template repo for Terraform modules

This repository contains my template for creating Terraform modules, yes even my
root modules.

## Tools that I use

I use a wide array of tools to make things easier for me.

- [1Password](https://1password.com/): Password and Secret storage
  - `brew install 1password`
- [1Password - CLI](https://1password.com/downloads/command-line/): Allows for
  access to 1Password via environment variables and shell scripts.
  - `brew install 1password-cli`
- [Direnv](https://direnv.net/): Manages dynamic environment variables based on
  the directory.
  - `brew install direnv`
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev/): Replacement for GNU make. Uses YAML files.
  - `brew install go-task`
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html): Kind of the whole point
  here ðŸ˜„
  - `brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform`
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads): Another obvious one ðŸ˜ƒ
  - `brew install git`
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/): Provides a method for running scripts
  and other tools during the `git commit` process.
  - `brew install pre-commit`
- [trufflehog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog): Scans your git
  repo for committed secrets ðŸ˜±.
  - `brew install trufflesecurity/trufflehog/trufflehog`

### Tools needed for the Pre-commit hooks that I use:

All of these tools can be used standalone, but I use them as part of the git
commit process.

- [terraform-docs](https://github.com/terraform-docs/terraform-docs):
  Dynamically updates your README.md with information on the inputs, outputs,
  and requirements of your module.
  - `brew install terraform-docs`
- [infracost](https://github.com/infracost/infracost): Gives you a cost estimate
  for the cloud resources your module would deploy.
  - `brew install infracost`
- [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq): A lightweight and flexible command-line
  JSON processor. required for `terraform_validate` with
  `--retry-once-with-cleanup` flag, and for `infracost_breakdown` hook.
  - `brew install jq`
- One or more of these terraform security scanning tools
  - [checkov](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov)
    - `brew install checkov`
  - [terrascan](https://github.com/tenable/terrascan)
    - `brew install terrascan`
  - [TFLint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint)
    - `brew install tflint`
  - [TFSec](https://tfsec.dev)
    - `brew install tfsec`

### Terraform Maintenance tools

Here are a couple of tools I use to help with managing Terraform versions.

- [TFSwitch](https://tfswitch.warrensbox.com/): Used to switch the version of
  terraform installed based on the directory you are in or the version
  constraint in your terraform code.
  - `brew install warrensbox/tap/tfswitch`
- [tfupdate](https://github.com/minamijoyo/tfupdate): Used to update the version
  constraints in your terraform code for core, providers and modules.
  - `brew install tfupdate`

## Example config files

I've included example config files for some of the tools.

`direnv`: Rename `.envrc.example` to `.envrc` and update.

`pre-commit`: Review `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to enable/disable hooks.

`terraform-docs`: Review `.terraform-docs.yml` to adjust document formatting
options.

`TFLint`: Review `.tflint.hcl`

`TFSec`: Review `.tfsec.yml`

`Task`: Review `Taskfile.yaml` and or remove tasks.

`Terraform`: Rename `terraform.tfvars.example` to `terraform.tfvars` and update.

## Terraform Docs Dynamic section

Everything above this should be removed and replaced with your module
description.

The following two lines specify where the `terraform-docs` dynamic content will
be placed.
